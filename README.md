# Football Live Scoreboard

This repository contains an application for a **Football Live Scoreboard** using WebSocket technology, implemented with the help of the **socket.io** library.

## Overview

The application allows users to operate and view live football scores in real-time. It features several key interfaces:
- **Match Pre-Data Interface**: For setting up countries before the match starts.
- **Match Operator Interface**: For managing and updating the live scores along with flags.
- **Customer Interface**: For viewers to see the live scores along with flags.
- **User Authentication**: Allows admins and users to sign up, log in, and manage sessions.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes using a toggle button, powered by Context API and Bootstrap styles.

### Reusable Components

To enhance maintainability and ensure consistency, several reusable components have been introduced:
- **InputField**: A general-purpose input field component for text inputs, including form labels and error messages.
- **PasswordField**: A specialized component for password fields with a visibility toggle for improved user experience.

These components help in maintaining a consistent look and feel across different forms and simplify updates and maintenance.

## Features

- Real-time score updates using WebSocket.
- Separate interfaces for operators and viewers.
- User-friendly design with Bootstrap for styling.
- Pre-match setup for selecting countries.
- User and admin authentication with JWT.
- NavBar with login, signup, and logout options.
- Theme toggle for switching between light and dark modes.
- **Reusable Components**: Enhanced code reusability and maintainability with dedicated components for input fields and password management.
